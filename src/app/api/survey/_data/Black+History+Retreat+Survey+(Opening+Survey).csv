I also admired Mr. Charles work to make sure the unsung heroes of the movement are remembered.  I believe we have many of the same in RI and would like to see how we can lift them up.","One aspect of the trip I felt was missing was not deeply exploring the challenges of Black leaders in general, Black women specifically, and how we show up for and receive one another.  There were times when I felt a little tension from others and didn't know where to go with it.","Reflection - I brought with me the book The Alchemist to finish reading on the trip.  As I listened to the many stories throughout the week, I thought about the theme of the book and the purpose driven life of Michelle, Brian, Evan, the Judges, and everyone else. Very inspiring!","More connection, less reflection.  I am a processor, so reflection takes me a minute, or a few days!  I appreciated the check-ins but really would love to see more time dedicated to getting to know other cohort participants.  Even at the regional cohort dinner on Tuesday, we sat at separate tables. Perhaps  more intentional relationship building, mixing the cohorts, speed dating type activity is what was missing for me.  We had touchpoints, but nothing deep. I'm hoping leadership challenges will be further explored as the program moves forward.  Overall, the week was moving, humbling, reflective, and a healing experience.","I've always wanted to go to Alabama to explore the history of the civil rights movement.  However, my soul never felt it was a safe space to be.  I've been to the deep South before, but there was something about Alabama that was different. Having INP hold my hand and take me, and 35 other Black leaders, on an epic journey was extraordinary to say the least. Every story, every experience was connected to a profound message of hope that I believe resonated with all.

I also learned in that “Divine Timing” is a healthy part of life to remove the unnecessary worry. 

Practically I learned to utilize BLI as a resource to support the growth of my LLC for example how can I shape my vision to hone in on (2) paths of action one for healing and another for disrupting institutional structures that limit the stories of Black Queer Voices particularly Black Queer Southern voices to be seen, heard, and nurtured.","The ability to have a coach who is skilled at starting up a nonprofit or business to support my continued growth and development of my LLC.","It wasn’t one moment it was the amalgamation of all of the days. 
Day one: RESIST, REENERGIZE, REARM 
Day two: Being in relationships with 1800s slavery archives, witnessing the transitioning of history to digital accessibility, hearing the voices of ALs living histories in the HARRIS HOUSE. sharpening my own limited knowledge related to the warm reckoning of The Mothers of Gynecology. 
Day three: The panel was life giving the the Legendary Foot Soldier freedom fighter, Mrs. Sophia, and brother Evan were living history and Ms. Martha was by far the best dose of reality we had needed. The museum was something out of a movie. We experienced elegance and history all in one night. Yet it was the letters circle that left be both renewed and emotional in the softest manner. 
Day four: Ripped my heart out and placed it back softly. Day four was painfully necessary and without it the total BLI Rites of Passage would not be complete and no where near  as impactful. It wasn’t about what I saw or read it was about what I FELT and the lingering of lessons. 
Day five: Was intentional and it allowed both mentally and physically for me to soak up all of the feelings I felt all week. 

I’d also add the down time was essential to building bonds and the meals were delicious.","I think this was near exactly 100% of what it needed to be. This is feedback not a critique. I would welcome more intentionality around LGBTQ+ Black folk in BLI to my discovery I found (3) of us out of 35 yet if there were more they weren’t comfortable sharing. I’d love for our Black leadership spaces to welcome men  and women of the Trans Experience and be intentional with our BLI recruitment to ensure all full spectrum of Blackness if present. 

Maybe having the debriefing from Day Four also be a hybrid option b/c I would have joined from the comfort of my room. I but I needed to be in a soft space immediately following. 

Hosting an optional physical activity like morning yoga or a collective afternoon jog along the AL River would have also been another nice way to connect 

The lunch on the bus on the way and on the drive back was not the best selection. Does Martha make sandwiches lol👀","BLI as one of my Fellows shared is a RITES of PASSAGE. This was more than a leadership experience it was a transformational life changing & purpose enhancing journey through American History in the most raw and unapologetic approach. BLI didn’t treat the narratives of our ancestors hastily, they provided us with soft and thoughtful landing pads to sift through the trauma and emotions we felt, and made space for us to experience reflect on our own time. The leadership of the Black History Retreat needs to be a model haled for this precise and unique programming and curriculum skills as this is a national model I feel can benefit every Black Leader in this nation.  

As a Black Queer/Gay man who grew up in Birmingham, AL returning to my home state via the care of BLI was more powerful than you might imagine. Words cannot illustrate my internal shift that took place I will be processing this experience differently from my fellow BLI fellows yet I know I have my regional cohort and my national brothers and sisters to support me along the way.",Yes,a0mPn00000B3fQ5,0035b00002pm70m,"BLI Black History Retreat Survey (Opening Survey) (copy)","2025-01-18 11:13:12","2025-01-18 11:13:12","1 hr. 11 min.",,,,,https://app.formassembly.com/responses/view/368421434,,,,368421434,"https://www.tfaforms.com/5160181?tfa_5545=a0mPn00000B3fQ5&tfa_5546=0035b00002pm70m&tfa_5277=Vincent&tfa_5279=Harris&tfa_5305=Associate%20Dean%20and%20Director,%20Brown%20Center%20for%20Students%20of%20Color&tfa_5306=",70.172.205.134

To enhance my effectiveness in community spaces, I seek ongoing support that recognizes and values the strength of quiet leadership.","The most impactful moment of the retreat was visiting the Harris House, where I stood in the same space as the Freedom Riders, Martin Luther King Jr., and John Lewis—foot soldiers who sacrificed their lives for my right to work, live, and pursue my dreams today.",,"The INP Black Leadership Institute is a groundbreaking initiative and one of the most impactful leadership development opportunities in the nation. It addresses cultural issues, purpose, and systemic change while challenging complacency within the Black agenda. This essential learning journey supports Black leaders who often take on leadership roles driven by a deep commitment to advocate for the issues and communities they care about. However, these leaders frequently do not receive the investment that reflects their dedication to their work, communities, and sectors.

Creating a focused leadership experience rooted in the rich foundations of Black history is vital for the advancement of Black professionals. It is essential to commit to sustained funding for this initiative to eliminate barriers related to affordability and dedication, and to establish a pathway toward executive professional advancement and training. Financial support is crucial for this transformative effort, as it directly contributes to the ongoing pursuit of liberation, equality, and justice for the Black community.

Still working it out but it will not be the sermon folks are expecting.","No. I’ve been given so much this week. It’s been rich, multi-layered, and provocative.","I’m an introvert and it’s been challenging to be in the room with “the fluff” and credentialing. It’s been hard for me to get past that and get to some of the people, but…the ones I’ve found or who have found me have been vulnerable, sincere, and supportive. 

I had a powerful connection with Myesha where she saw me, told me what she felt about me and how she intended to support me going forward. She’s in LA. I’m in NYC. And we will continue to connect when I’m on the west coast next month and beyond. I’m deeply grateful for her energy, that she saw me, and that she offered me something without expectation of return.","Thank you for the balance of “ordinary” people and people with names and pedigrees. It was so good, for me, to hear from grassroots folks. I move in such rarified spaces that time with folks on the ground really fed my soul. 

I long for more time for small group reflection and individual reflection time. 

In conversation with my cohort, it appears some are not clear about the time commitment or that our regional meetings are in person. I thought this was clear, but maybe there is a way to make this even more explicit so expectations are managed. When I brought this up in small group I got a bit shredded but was glad to later hear Karon and Anthony talk about the investment in us and the need to be present for each other.","At this moment in our nation’s history, when Black people, women, and the poor are experiencing the roll back of our rights and future hopes, I believe the bold and sustained investment in creative Black leadership is critical and urgent.

My body hums with the weight of history—  
tired and full, both of food and feeling,  
the echo of images, sounds, and stories,  
swirling, deep inside my chest.  
I move through this city,  
where past and present collide,  
feeling the pulse of it,  
heavy and alive.  

I float down the Alabama River,  
the water cold and unforgiving,  
and I feel their ghosts—  
the souls of those enslaved—  
haunting the air,  
whispering through the current,  
their pain, their strength,  
trapped in time,  
but somehow still here.  

Montgomery’s streets carry this weight,  
but also resilience,  
in the cracked pavement,  
in the hum of life all around.  
The Harris House is a home  
built on brilliance,  
on the shoulders of ancestors,  
and I am blessed to stand in its rooms,  
a witness to what came before,  
what lives on.

The Mothers of Gynecology Museum—  
a testament to pain and genius,  
to survival and hope,  
showing me that brilliance,  
born of cruelty,  
can still bloom in the darkest soil.  
I see the art—  
in the freedom garden,  
in the sculpted forms  
that speak louder than words,  
reminding me that resistance  
is also beauty,  
is also joy.

I think of the bus rides,  
the walk to work,  
the fight for something so simple  
as a seat in the front.  
What am I prepared for,  
now that I see it with new eyes?  
How do I use my strength?  
What do I center now?

I’m drawn to social justice—  
maybe through the arts,  
where creativity is the muscle  
that builds the heart of resistance,  
where beauty becomes the weapon  
and the sanctuary.

I long for spaces that celebrate  
our joy as much as our struggle,  
museums that hold our brilliance  
in the light,  
in every corner of our existence.  
Where the stories of our joy  
are told as fiercely as the stories of pain.

My spirit—  
it carries grief,  
for the trauma lived  
in flesh and blood,  
in the sweat of our ancestors' backs,  
in the blood spilled,  
but it also carries joy,  
the kind that survives,  
that refuses to break.  
I feel the anger,  
for those who fed the fire  
of hatred and death,  
but more, I feel  
the spark of something else—  
hope,  
creativity,  
and love.  
It lives in our bones,  
in our strength,  
in our ability  
to rise, again and again.

This is my heart.  
This is the story I carry now—  
one of pain,  
and of power,  
of creation,  
and of liberation.  
And the question lingers:  
how will I walk this path?  
How will I answer,  
what I have seen,  
what I have learned,  
what my heart knows to be true?",Yes,,,"BLI Black History Retreat Survey (Opening Survey) (copy)","2025-01-17 13:01:06","2025-01-17 13:01:06","4 min. 24 sec.",,,,,https://app.formassembly.com/responses/view/368374800,,,,368374800,https://www.tfaforms.com/5160181,174.201.157.153
